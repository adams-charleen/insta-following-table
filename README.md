# Network Analysis

## Methods

### Scraping Instagram: fetching basic metrics

The process used the Python script `insta_scrape.py` to collect data from 37 hand-curated Instagram accounts by automating a web browser with a tool called Selenium. The script started by setting up a Chrome browser in a way that mimics a real user, either visibly or in the background (headless mode). It logged into Instagram using a provided username and password by navigating to the login page, entering the credentials, and clicking the login button, while also handling popups like "Save Login Info" and "Turn on Notifications" by clicking "Not Now" if they appeared. The script then visited the profile pages of a list of 37 specified Instagram handles, such as "harvardoop" and "jvpboston," to scrape data. For each account, it checked if the profile was private or nonexistent, and if accessible, it extracted the number of posts, followers, and accounts the user was following from the profile's header section. To avoid being blocked by Instagram, the script paused for 3 seconds between each account and restarted the browser every 5 accounts. The collected data was saved into a text file called instagram_results.txt

### Scraping Instagram: fetching who the 37 follow

The data collection was carried out using the Python script `handles_scrape.py` that accessed Instagram data through direct web requests with the requests library, bypassing the need for a browser. The script first logged into Instagram by sending a login request with a provided username and password, mimicking a real user by including specific headers like a user agent and an Instagram app ID, and obtaining session cookies for authentication. Using these cookies, the script then retrieved the list of accounts followed by each of 37 specified Instagram handles, such as "harvardoop" and "jvpboston." For each handle, it accessed the user’s profile to get their user ID, then fetched their "following" list in batches of 100 accounts at a time, continuing until all followed accounts were collected. To avoid being blocked by Instagram, the script paused for a random duration between 1 to 3 seconds between batch requests and 2 to 4 seconds between different handles. The collected following lists were saved into a text file named instagram_following.txt in a designated folder for further analysis.

### Network analyses

Network analyses were based on the Python script `deeper_network_dive.py` that processed Instagram following data from the file instagram_following.txt to construct a directed network graph, where nodes represent Instagram accounts and edges represent follow relationships. Using the NetworkX library, the script calculated several network metrics: in-degree centrality (to identify the most followed accounts), out-degree centrality (to find accounts following the most others), betweenness centrality (to detect key connectors), closeness centrality (to measure proximity to other accounts), and PageRank (to assess influence). The Louvain method was applied for community detection to identify clusters of accounts, and the largest communities (350–450 accounts) were categorized into University, Regional, Thematic, or Other based on account naming patterns. Visualizations were generated, including a community size distribution, bar plots for in-degree and out-degree centrality, a subgraph of the top 10 most followed accounts, and a circular layout of the network with communities.

## Results

The top 10 most followed accounts (in-degree centrality) included "harvardundergradpsc" (0.0056), "harvardoop" (0.0054), and "palestinianyouthmovement" (0.0054), while "jvpboston" (0.1892) and "hiddenpalestine" (0.1536) had the highest out-degree centrality, indicating they follow the most accounts. "jvpboston" also led in betweenness centrality (0.0010), marking it as a key connector, followed by "harvardoop" (0.0009). For closeness centrality, "harvardundergradpsc" (0.0058) and "palestinianyouthmovement" (0.0057) were the most central, and "harvardundergradpsc" had the highest PageRank (0.00027), indicating strong influence, followed by "harvardoop" (0.00027). Community detection identified 16 communities, with sizes ranging from 152 to 622 accounts, as shown in the "Distribution of Community Sizes" histogram. The largest communities (350–450 accounts) were analyzed for composition: Community 4 (432 accounts) had 7 University, 7 Regional, 218 Thematic, and 200 Other accounts; Community 11 (413 accounts) had 10 University, 9 Regional, 55 Thematic, and 339 Other accounts; Community 6 (399 accounts) had 13 University, 25 Regional, 35 Thematic, and 326 Other accounts; Community 12 (391 accounts) had 9 University, 8 Regional, 94 Thematic, and 280 Other accounts; and Community 13 (357 accounts) had 22 University, 2 Regional, 111 Thematic, and 222 Other accounts.

## Conclusions and Interpretations 

The Instagram following network highlights a structure where accounts like "harvardundergradpsc" and "harvardoop" are highly influential, as they are the most followed, have high influence (PageRank), and are well-connected (closeness centrality), likely acting as central hubs within the network. "jvpboston" stands out as a key connector (high betweenness centrality) and is highly active in following others (out-degree centrality), suggesting it bridges different parts of the network. The community analysis shows 16 distinct clusters, with the largest communities (350–450 accounts) predominantly consisting of "Other" accounts (200–339), followed by "Thematic" accounts (35–218), indicating a diverse network with a strong presence of accounts focused on specific themes, such as activism (e.g., Palestine-related, given names like "palestinianyouthmovement" and "bdsboston"). University and Regional accounts are less dominant in these large communities, suggesting that while university-affiliated accounts (e.g., Harvard-related) are influential, the broader network is driven by thematic and diverse affiliations, likely centered around shared social or activist causes. The community size distribution further indicates a skewed structure, with a few large communities and many smaller ones, reflecting a network where certain clusters have significant reach while others are more niche.
